F = e*E
disp("E = "+string(E)+"ax V/m")//initializing electic field
disp("e = "+string(e)+"C")//intializing electron charge
disp("F = eE = "+string(F)+"ax N")//calculation for force on electron due to electric field

//  NOTE : answer provided in the textbook is wrong Correct answer is, -3.2*10^16ax N
