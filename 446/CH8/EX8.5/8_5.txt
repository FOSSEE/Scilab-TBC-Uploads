 The nitrogen atom has a configuration of 1s2,2s2,2p3.   
 
 Let us maximize the net spin of all the 3 electrons by assigning a spin of 1/2 to each of them. Hence S=3/2.   
 
 To maximize Ml,the consistent values of L for the 3 electrons left are 1 -1 and 0.Thus L=0 & S=3/2 are the ground state quantum numbers for nitrogen.
