 Ex-4.4(a)   
Uncertainity in position is 3.20 nm 
 Ex-4.4((b)   
Since the motion is strictly along X-direction, its velocity in Y direction is absolutely zero.
 So uncertainity in velocity along y is zero=> uncertainity in position along y is infinite. 
So nothing can be said about its position/motion along Y
