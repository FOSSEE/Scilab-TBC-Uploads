This is a forced, steady state vibration situation.

There are 2 supporting springs, hence net stiffness Ke=2k
Damping coefficient Ce = 0.05 Cc = 0.05*2*sqrt(Ke*m)

The expression for desired amplitude Y is

	Y=Fo/sqrt((ke-m*w^2)^2+(Ce*w)^2)
Y will be maximum at resonance, i.e., w=wn
Thus the design condition is k=(1/2)m*w^2
	k=21.73 kN/m

At resonance, Y=Fo/c*w
The peak solenoid force required is 2.17 N
