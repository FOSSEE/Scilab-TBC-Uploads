(a)Gear diameters:
	Da=210 mm
	Db=390 mm
	Dc=270 mm

(b)Torque on shafts:
	Mta=47.75 Nm
	Mtb=0 Nm
	Mtc=61.4 Nm

(c)Tangential force on gear A: Ft=454 N
   Separating force Fr=165 N

(d)The same tangential and separating force occurs between gears
A and B and between gears B and C.

(e) The tooth load for which each gear must be designed is 454 N

(f)The force applied to idler shaft of gear B is the vector sum
of the forces applied to gear B by A and C
Fb=sqrt(2*(Ft^2 + Fr^2))=684 N
