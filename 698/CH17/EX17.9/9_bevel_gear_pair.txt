(a)First finding various dimensions:
	Torque Mt=190 Nm
	diameter of pinion=200 mm
	diameter of gear=600 mm
	Slant height of pitch cone=316.23 mm
	Mean radius of pinion=89.41 mm

(b) Finding various forces:
Tangential force at mean radius=2136.16 N

Pinion thrust force=245.87 N

Gear thrust force=737.60 N
