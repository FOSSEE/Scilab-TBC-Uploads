The angular speed of wheels is 29.3 rad/s
All points on the side rod have a downward acceleration ap
The locomotive is moving with uniform velocity, therefore acceleration ao=0

	ap=ao+apo
	  =apo=322.51m/s^2

Inertia force acting upward on the rod, Fi=58051.15 N

Net force acting upward on the rod, Fup=56285.35 N

Axial force F can be determined by assuming rear wheel
and rod as free bodies and taking moments about centre of wheel.
	Cl*F= Et*R
The axial force F is 109800.00 N

Maximum bending moment for simple beam carrying unifornmly distributed load is
	(W*L)/8

Normal Stress 
	Sx= (P/A) + (M*c)/I

The maximum normal stress is 
	Sn_max = Sx = 59.8 MN/m^2

The maximum shear stress is 
	Tmax = Sx/2 = 29.9 MN/m^2
