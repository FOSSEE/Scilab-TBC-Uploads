The force produces deflection in both the portions of steel.
Total deflection will be sum of inividual deflections.
The deflection is given by:
		x=(F*L)/(A*E)
		x=x1+x2

The total deflection is 3.183 mm

	Stress=Force/Area

The tensile stress at larger cross section area is 25.46 MPa
The tensile stress at smaller cross section area is 101.86 MPa
