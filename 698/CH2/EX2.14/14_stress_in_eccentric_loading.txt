The member is subjected to direct stress and 
also bending stresses due to eccentricity of the load
 Total stress 
	S=Sd + Sb --- This will be compressive, since Sd is compressive, and Sb is acting in the direction of Sd
	S=Sd - Sb --- This will be compressive, since Sb is opposing Sd

Stresses induced are -20.833 MPa compressive and 4.167 MPa tensile
Maximum Tensile Stress is 4.167 MPa
