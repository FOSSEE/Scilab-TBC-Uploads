   Minimum normal stress=0.00 MN/m^2
   Maximum shear stress=3.82 MN/m^2


(b) BENDING ONLY
  Section at which cantilever is fixed is critical
  	{Sx=(M*c)/I at topmost point of section at which cantilever is fixed}
  At the topmost point of section at which cantilever is fixed,
  Sx=61.12 MN/m^2
  Txy=0.00 MN/m^2
   Maximum normal stress=61.12 MN/m^2
   Minimum normal stress=0.00 MN/m^2
   Maximum shear stress=30.56 MN/m^2

  	{Sx=-(M*c)/I at topmost point of section at which cantilever is fixed}
  At the bottom point of section at which cantilever is fixed,
  Sx=-61.12 MN/m^2
  Txy=0.00 MN/m^2
   Maximum normal stress=0.00 MN/m^2

(c) TORSION ONLY
  Here, the critical points occur along the outer surface of the member

(d) BENDING AND TORSION
  Section at which cantilever is fixed is critical
  At the topmost point of section at which cantilever is fixed,
  Sx=61.12 MN/m^2
  Txy=40.74 MN/m^2
   Maximum normal stress=81.49 MN/m^2
   Minimum normal stress=-20.37 MN/m^2
   Maximum shear stress=50.93 MN/m^2

  At the bottom point of section at which cantilever is fixed,
  Sx=-61.12 MN/m^2
  Txy=40.74 MN/m^2
   Maximum normal stress=20.37 MN/m^2
   Minimum normal stress=-81.49 MN/m^2
   Maximum shear stress=50.93 MN/m^2

  The magnitudes of stresses at the two points are same.
  The different signs of normal stresses indicate that while topmost fibres are in
  tension,the bottom fibres are in compression.
  The different signs of shear stress are of no consequence.
