The maximum shear stress may occur at two locations:
	a) Surface of the cantilever (due to bending moment)
		 OR
	b) Midsection of the cantilever (due to transverse shear load)


Shear stress on the surface is 3.6 MN/m^2
Shear stress at the midsection is 4.5 MN/m^2


Maximum shear stress occurs at the midsection and is equal to 4.5 MN/m^2
