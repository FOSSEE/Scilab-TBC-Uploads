Bending moment due to horizontal load about midpoint Mx= 250.00 Nm
Bending moment due to vertical load about midpoint My= -400.00 Nm
The total bending moment:
	M=sqrt((Mx^2)+(My^2))
The total bending moment M = 471.70 Nm

The normal stress is given by
	Sx=Py/A-((M*(d/2))/I)
Normal stress acting at the section is -39.46 MN/m^2

The shear stress is given by
	Txy=(T*(d/2))/J
Normal stress acting at the section is 8.15 MN/m^2

Maximum normal stress is 1.62 MN/m^2
Minimum normal stress is -41.07 MN/m^2

The maximum numerical normal stress is 41.07 MN/m^2
The maximum shear stress is 21.344732 MN/m^2
