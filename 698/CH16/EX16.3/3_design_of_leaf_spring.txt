(a) Bending stress s=(6*F*L)/(n*b*(t^2))
deflection y= (12*F*(L^3))/(b*(t^3)*n*E)

(b) From above,
	s/y = Et/L^2
t=19.125 mm

(c) Strain energy of cantilever leaf spring
	=s^2/ 6E * Volume of spring
The width is 19.30f mm
The thickness can be taken as 20.00 mm
The width can be taken as 20.00 mm
