Pressure variation is given by 
p=C/r =F/(2*pi*(Ro-Ri)*r)

Maximum pressure intensity occurs at inner radius r=Ri
The maximum intensity of pressure is 254.6 kN/m^2

Minimum pressure intensity occurs at outer radius r=Ro
The minimum intensity of pressure is equal to 127.3 kN/m2

Average intensity of pressure
The average intensity of pressure is equal to 169.8 kN/m2
