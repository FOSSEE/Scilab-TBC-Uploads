(a)Torque transmitting capacity of clutch is 119.366 Nm

(b)To find axial thrust and dimensions, we need to solve the following equations:
	F=pmax*2*pi*(Ri^2)*(r-1)---Eq 1
	(F*Ri)=(2*T*sin(alpha))/(f*(1+r))---Eq 2

(c)Width of face is half of mean radius:
	b=(1/2)*Rm
	Ro=r*Ri
	where r=(4+sin (alpha))/(4-sin (alpha))

(d)Solving the above equations, we get
	MAIN DIMENSIONS:
Inner radius of clutch is 125.00 mm
Outer radius of clutch is 140.00 mm
face width of clutch is 66.25 mm

Axial force required to engage the clutch is 971.930 N
