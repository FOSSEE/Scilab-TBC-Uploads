(a) Considering uniform wear theory, the torque is 1044.91 N-m

(b) Considering uniform pressure theory, the torque is 1099.35 N-m

(c) From above two values of torque, it is evident that the uniform wear theory
gives conservative result, which is better for designing of the clutch.
As for the new clutch where uniform pressure condition prevails, the torque capacity
will be more than designed and when the clutch becomes old,
(where the uniform wear prevails) the clutch is still capable of transmitting required torque.
