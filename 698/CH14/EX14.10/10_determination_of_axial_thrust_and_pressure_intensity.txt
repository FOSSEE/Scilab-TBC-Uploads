(a)Axial thrust required to transmit the power is 848.83 N
(b)The pressure equation is:
	p=F/(2*pi*(Ro-Ri)*r)

(c)	Maximum contact pressure occurs at inner radius, and is equal to 0.108 MPa
   	Minimum contact pressure occurs at outer radius, and is equal to 0.072 MPa
   	Average contact pressure is 0.086 MPa
