When a clutch is new, the pressure may be rather uniform.
If the surfaces are relatively rigid, the outer portion, where velocity is high,
will wear more than inner portion.
After the initial wearing-in,it is reasonable to assume that the curve of the profile will maintain its shape;
or, the wear thereafter may be considered to be uniform.
Uniform wear can be expressed in a different way by saying that
at any time interval, the work done per unit area is constant:
[(frictional force)*(velocity)]/area = 
	[(f*p*2*pi*r dr)*(rw)]/(2*pi*r dr) = constant C
or
	p=C'/f*r*w	 Since f and w are constant,
	p=C/r, where C is constant.
An alternate method of showing that pressure varies inversely as the radius is
to consider that wear (delta) is proportional to pressure p and velocity V.
Thus 
	(delta)=K*p*V=K*p*(r*w),
or
	p=C/r		since (delta) and K are constants and w is fixed for a given clutch.
The differential frictional torque=dT= r(f*p(2*pi*r dR));

Intergrating with respect to r over r=Ri to r=Ro,
we get the total torque as
		T=2*pi*f*C[((Ro^2)-(Ri^2))/2]

To find C, we can integrate p(2*pi*r dr) with respect to r over r=Ri to r=Ro
We get
		C=F/(2*pi*(Ro-Ri))

Substituting this value of C into T
We obtain

		T=F*f*[(1/2)*(Ro+Ri)] = F*f*Rf
