(a)Average torque Mt=5968.31 Nm

(b)Energy output per cycle=75000.00 Nm
Energy output during power stroke=112500.00 Nm
Energy stored in the flywheel=106531.69 Nm

(c)Stress=rho*V^2
	V=23.57 m/s
	V=r*w
	r=V/w=1.125 m

(d)Mass of rim of flywheel:
	mr=(K*E)/(V^2 *delta) =5752.71 kg

(e)Dimensions of rim
	mr=pi*Dm*t*b*rho
For square rim, t=b=0.336 m

For rectangular rim, b=2t=0.475 m and t=0.238 m
