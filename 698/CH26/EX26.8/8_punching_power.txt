(a)For punching operation, requirement of power:
Maximum shear force=Sut*Area =471238.9 N
Energy required per stroke=4712.389 Nm
Total energy required per minute=117809.72 Nm
Power of Motor=2181.66 W

(b)Energy stored in flywheel:
	=4241.15 Nm
Out of this,5% is supplied by arms and hub, and 95% by rim
	mr=185.791 kg

(c)mr=pi*Dm*t*b*rho
For rectangular rim, b=2t=0.114 m and t=0.057 m
Checking for stresses,
St=rho*V^2=1.57Mpa, which is less than 6Mpa, hence safe.
