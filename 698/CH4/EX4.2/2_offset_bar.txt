(a) The bending moment at every section is=126 Nm

(b) Refer to figure 4.3[A. Hall; Schaum's Outline on Machine Design]
Tension occurs in upper fibres and compression in lower fibres.
Maximum normal stress occurs at R=90mm and is compressive
Location of maximum tensile stress is to be determined

(c)For section R=90mm
	Distance between centre of gravity and neutral axis e=0.000582 m

(d)For section with R=90mm, stess at inner fibre
	Si=M*hi/ A*e*ri
	=26.65 MN/m^2 compression
Stess at outer fibre
	So=M*ho/ A*e*ro
	=22.15 MN/m^2 tension

For section R=115mm
	Distance between centre of gravity and neutral axis e=0.0005 m

(e)For section with R=115mm, stess at inner fibre
	Si=M*hi/ A*e*ri
	=23.60 MN/m^2 tension
Stess at outer fibre
	So=M*ho/ A*e*ro
	=20.56 MN/m^2 compression

(f) Maximum tension occurs at inner fibre of section R=115mm
Maximum compression occurs at inner fibre of section R=90mm
Maximum shear stress=half of greatest difference between any two extremes=13.3 MN/m^2
