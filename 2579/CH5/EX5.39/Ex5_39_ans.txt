 Directivity: The max directive gain is called directivity of an antenna.
 Directivity= max radiation intensity of test antenna/average radiation intensity of test antenna 
 Polarization: Polarization of an antenna means the direction of electric field of the electromagnetic wave being radiated by the transmitting syatem.
 Virtual Height: Virtual height of an ionospheric layer may be defined as the height to which short pulse of energy sent vertically upward and travelling with speed of light would reach taking the same ways travel time as does the actual pulse reflected from the layer.
 Practically the virtual height is alway greater than actual height
