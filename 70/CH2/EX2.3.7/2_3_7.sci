disp('The column space of A is excatly the space that is spanned by its columns.The row space is spanned by the rows.The definition is made to order.Multiplying A by any x gives a combination of columns; it is a vector Ax in the column space. The coordinate vectors e_1,....e_n coming from the identity matrix span Rn. Every vector b=(b_1.....,b_n) is a combination of those columns.In this example the weights are the components b_i themselves:b=b_1e_1+.....+b_ne_n.But the columns of other matrices also span R_.')
