disp('Here,the vector v1 by itself is linearly independent , but it fails to span R2.The three vectors v1,v2,v3 certainly span R2, but are not independent. Any two of these vectors say v1 and v2 have both properties -they span and they are independent.So they form a basis.(A vector space does not have a unique basis)')
