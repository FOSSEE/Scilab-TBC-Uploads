// Using Principle of Conservation of Angular Momentum,
//Eqn 1 : (0.2-0.03)*10*(v_G)1+0.156*w_1=0.2*10*(v_G)2+0.156*w_2
//Since no slipping occurs,equation 1 reduces to (v_G)2=0.892*(v_G)1
//Using Conservation of Energy Principle, Equation 2 is: 0.5*10*(v_G)2^2 +  0.5*0.156*w_2^2+0=0+{98.1*0.03}
//Put w_2=5*(v_G)2 and equation 1 in the above equation,
