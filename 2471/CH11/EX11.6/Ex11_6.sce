printf('In a heat-pump system the work input to drive the compressor,W, produces a heat absorption capacity,Q2,\nand to balance the energy flow, a quantity of heat, Q1, must be dissipated.\nThus the energy equation is\n -> Q1 = W + Q2\nand the coeffient of performance is \nC.O.P. = Q1/W = Q1/(Q1 - Q2)\n   Consequently the C.O.P. is always greater than unity.\nThe maximum theoretical value of the C.O.P. is that predicted by the Carnot in chapter 2,namely :\n -> (C.O.P.)max = T1/(T1 - T2)')
