//Variable Declaration
p1=0.87       // probability of Repair on the engine
p2=0.36       // probability of drive train
p3=0.29       // probability of rapair as well as drive train

//Calculation


P = p1+p2-p3    // Required probability

//Results
printf ( "probability of at least one kind of repair: %.2f",P)
