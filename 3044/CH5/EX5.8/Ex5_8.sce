// Variable declaration
Mean = -4.6
variance = 1.21 
x = 0.0015   // oz/st gold

// Calculation
Lower = (log(x)-Mean)/sqrt(variance)

// We need to calculate F- Value for lower i.e. F(-1.73) to be find out.
// Using table F(-1.73) = 0.0419
// As F-value is too small 

// Result
printf ( "Specimen was collected outside of vein.")
