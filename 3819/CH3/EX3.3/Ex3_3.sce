// Chapter 3-Hydrostatic Forces on surfaces
// Problem 3.3

//Data given in the Problem
//depth of gate=d m
//width of gate=b m
//depth of CG from surface=p m

//solution:
//Depth of COP from free surface=(I/(A*h_CG))+h_gate
//Since I=(b*d^3)/12;
//h_COP=(b*d^3/12/b/d/p)+p=d^2/12+p
disp("The depth of centre of pressure from free surface is (d^2/12)+p ")
