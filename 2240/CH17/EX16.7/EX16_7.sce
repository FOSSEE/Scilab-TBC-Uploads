// Determine the value of cpacitance for the film capacitors in Fig. 16-12a and b

disp ('In Fig. 16–12a , the first two numbers are 5 and 6, respectively, for 56 as the first two digits in the numerical value of the capacitance. The third number, 3, indicates a multiplier of 1000, or 56*1000 = 56,000 pF. The letter J indicates a capacitor tolerance of +-5%.')
disp ('In Fig. 16–12b , the first two numbers are 4 and 7, respectively, for 47 as the first two digits in the numerical value of the capacitance. The third number, 9, indicates a fractional multiplier of 0.1, or 47*0.1 = 4.7 pF. The letter C indicates a capacitor tolerance of +-0.25 pF.')
