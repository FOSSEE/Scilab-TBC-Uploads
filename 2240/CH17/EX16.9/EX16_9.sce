disp ('The dots in the top row are read from left to right in the direction of the arrow. In the bottom row, they are read in the reverse order from right to left. The first dot at the left in the top row is black, indicating a mica capacitor. The next two color dots are blue and red, for 62 as the first two digits in the numerical value of the capacitance. The next dot, at the far right in the bottom row, is red, indicating a multiplier of 100. Therefore, C = 62*100 = 6200 pF. The next dot is gold, indicating a capacitor tolerance of +-5%.')
