// For the tantalum capacitor shown in Fig. 16â€“21, determine the capacitance C in both pF and uF units. Also, determine the voltage rating and tolerance.

disp ('Moving from top to bottom, the first two color bands are yellow and violet, which represent the digits 4 and 7, respectively. The third color band is blue, indicating a multiplier of 1,000,000. Therefore the capacitance C is 47*1,000,000 = 47,000,000 pF, or 47 uF. The blue color at the left indicates a voltage rating of 35 V. And, finally, the silver dot at the very top indicates a tolerance of +-10%.')
