// Express the power value of 250-W using the appropriate metric prefix from Table I–2.

disp ('In this case, it is not necessary to use any of the metric prefixes listed in Table I–2. The reason is that 250-W cannot be expressed as a number between 1 and 1000 times a power of 10 which is a multiple of 3.')
disp ('250 W cannot be expressed in engineering notation. The closest we can come is 0.25*10^3-W, which is not representative of engineering notation. Although 10^3 can be replaced with the metric prefix kilo (k)')
disp ('It is usually preferable to express the power as 250-W and not as 0.25-kW.')
