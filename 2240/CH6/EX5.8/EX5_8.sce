// In Fig. 5â€“18a, suppose that the ammeter M1 reads 16-A instead of 20-A as it should. What could be wrong with the circuit?

disp ('Notice that the current I3 is supposed to be 4-A. If R3 is open, this explains why M1 reads a current that is 4-A less than its normal value. To confi rm that R3 is open; open S1 and disconnect the top lead of R3 from point E. Next place an ammeter between the top of R3 and point E. Now, close S1. If I3 measures 0-A, you know that R3 is open. If I3 measures 4-A, you know that one of the other branches is drawing less current than it should. In this case, the next step would be to measure each of the remaining branch currents to find the defective component.')
