printf("Another example of broadband transmission is the digital cellular telephone. For better reception, digital cellular phones convert the analog\nvoice signal to a digital signal.Although the bandwidth allocated to a company providing digital cellular phone service is very wide,\nwe still cannot send the digital signal without conversion. The reason is that we only have a bandpass channel available between caller and callee.\nFor example, if the available bandwidth is W and we allow 1000 couples to talk simultaneously, this means the available channel is W/1000,\njust part of the entire bandwidth. We need to convert the digitized voice to a composite analog signal before sending.\nThe digital cellular phones convert the analog audio signal to digital and then convert it again to analog for transmission over\na bandpass channel."); //display the example
