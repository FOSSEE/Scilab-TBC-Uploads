printf("The Nyquist theorem bit rate and the intuitive bit rate match when there are only two levels.\nIn baseband transmission, the bit rate is 2 times the bandwidth if only the first harmonic is used in the worst case.\nHowever, the Nyquist formula is more general than what we derived intuitively; it can be applied to baseband transmission and modulation.\nAlso, it can be applied when we have two or more levels of signals.") //display the answer
