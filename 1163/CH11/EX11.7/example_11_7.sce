printf("This example shows what happens when a frame is lost. The sequence of events that occur is as follows:\n\n* Frames 0, 1, 2, and 3 are sent. However, frame 1 is lost. The receiver receives frames 2 and 3, but they are discarded because they are received out\nof order (frame 1 is expected).\n\n* The sender receives no acknowledgment about frames 1, 2, or 3. Its timer finally expires. The sender sends all outstanding frames (1, 2, and 3)\nbecause it does not know what is wrong. The resending of frames l, 2, and 3 is the response to one single event.\n\n* When the sender is responding to this event, it cannot accept the triggering of other events. This means that when ACK 2 arrives,\nthe sender is still busy with sending frame 3. The physica1 layer must wait until this event is completed and the data link layer goes back\nto its sleeping state. A vertical line indicates this delay in the figure.\n\n* It is the same story with ACK 3; but when ACK 3 arrives, the sender is busy responding to ACK 2. It happens\nagain when ACK 4 arrives. Before the second timer expires, all outstanding frames have been sent and the timer is stopped.")
