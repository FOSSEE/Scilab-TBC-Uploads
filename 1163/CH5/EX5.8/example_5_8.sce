printf("\na. For ASK,only an in-phase carrier is used. Therefore, the two points should be on the X axis.\nBinary 0 has an amplitude of 0 V; binary 1 has an amplitude of 1V (for example). The points are located at the origin and at 1 unit.\n\n");
printf("b. BPSK also uses only an in-phase carrier. However, polar NRZ signal is used for modulation.\nIt creates two types of signal elements, one with amplitude 1 and the other with amplitude -1. This can be stated in other words:\nBPSK creates two different signal elements, one with amplitude 1 V and in phase and the other with amplitude 1 V and 180° out of phase.\n\n");
printf("c. QPSK uses two carriers, one in-phase and the other quadrature. The point representing 11 is made of two combined signal elements,\nboth with an amplitude of 1 V. One element is represented by an in-phase carrier, the other element by a quadrature carrier.\nThe amplitude of the final signal element sent for this 2-bit data element is 2^(1/2), and the phase is 45°.\nThe argument is similar for the other three points. All signal elements have an amplitude of 2^(1/2),\nbut their phases are different (45°, 135°, -135°, and -45°).Of course, we could have chosenthe amplitude of the carrier to be 1/(2^(1/2))\nto make the final amplitudes 1 V.");
