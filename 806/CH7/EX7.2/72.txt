 
 Dredging operations in a river yield la 
      rge volumes of sediments whose sma 
      llest particle is measured to be c 
      oarse sand with a diameter of 4 mi 
      crons and whose largest particle i 
      s coarse sand with a diameter of 1 
      000 microns or 1mm.determine the s 
      ettling velocity for each size cla 
      ss.Gw=9764 N/m^3;Ssand=2.65;Sclay= 
      1.6;and the viscosity at 30 degree 
       celsius is 0.8*10D-3 N.s/m^2      
 
 Solution:   
 
 (i)For clay particles:   
 
 Assuming reynolds number less than 1   
 
 R1=   
 
    3.255D-08  
 
 Since reynolds number is less than 1,he 
      nce                                
 
 Settling velocity for clay particles   
 
    0.0000065  
 
 m/s   
 
 (ii)For sand particles:   
 
 Assuming reynolds number greater than 1 
       and equal to 220 Cd=0.7           
 
 R2   
 
    219.41569  
 
 Since the reynolds number is greater th 
      an 1                               
 
 Hence the settling velovity =   
 
    0.1755325  
 
 m/s
