 
 A smooth flat plate 3 m wide and 30 m l 
      ong is towed through still water a 
      t 20 degree celsius with a speed o 
      f 6m/s.Determine the drag on one s 
      ide of the plate and the drag on t 
      he first 3 m of plate              
 
 Solution:   
 
 Drag force on whole plate   
 
    3176.7877  
 
 N   
 
 Drag force on first 3m   
 
    317.67877  
 
 N
