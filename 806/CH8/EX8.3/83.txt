 
 A source with strength 0.2m^3/s and a v 
      ortex with strength 1 m^2/s are lo 
      cated at the origin.Determine the  
      equations for velocity potential a 
      nd stream function.What are the ve 
      locity components at x=1 m,y=0.5 m 
      ?                                  
 
 Solution:   
 
 Vr=   
 
    0.0284705  
 
 m/s   
 
 Vt=   
 
    0.1423525
