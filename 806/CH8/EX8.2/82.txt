 
 A submarine moves through water at 30 f 
      t/s.At a point A on the submarine  
      5 ft above the nose,the velocity o 
      f the submarine relative to the wa 
      ter is 50 ft/s.Determine the dynam 
      ic-pressure difference between thi 
      s point and the nose,and determine 
       the difference in total pressure  
      between the two points.            
 
 If the submarine is sationary and the w 
      ater is movinf past it,The velocit 
      y at the nose is zero and the velo 
      city at A is 50ft/s.By selecting t 
      he dynamic pressure at infinity as 
       zero                              
 
 Hence dynamic pressure difference betwe 
      en point A and nose is=            
 
  - 2418.75  
 
 lb/ft^2   
 
 Hence total pressure difference between 
       point A and nose is=              
 
  - 2730.0334  
 
 lb/ft^2
