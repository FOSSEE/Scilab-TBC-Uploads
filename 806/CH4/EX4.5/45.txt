 
 Water is flowing through an open channel at a depth of 2 m and a velocity of 3m/s.it then flows through a contracting chute into another channel where the depth i 
      s 1 m and the velocity is 10m/s.assuming frictionless flow,determine the difference in the elevation of the channel floors.                                   
 
 Solution:   
 
 The points 1 and 2 can be selected on the free surface and therefore p1=p2=0   
 
 Therefore by bernoullis equation the difference in the elevation  of the channel is y=
