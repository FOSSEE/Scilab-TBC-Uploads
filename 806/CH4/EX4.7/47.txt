 
 The water supply reservoir as shown in  
      given figure has an average depth  
      of 20m, a surface area of 20km^2,  
      ans an outlet whose centerline is  
      15m below the water surface.If the 
       otflow diameter is 1 m, what is t 
      he outflow and its associated velo 
      city?What would be the drwa down d 
      uring one week and one day periods 
      ?                                  
 
 Solution:   
 
 Discharge   
 
    13.473642  
 
 m^3/s   
 
 Hence drop down in level for one day an 
      d one week are:                    
 
 draw down of one day   
 
    0.0582061  
 
 m   
 
 draw down of one week   
 
    0.4074429
