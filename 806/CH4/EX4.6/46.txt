 
 A venturimeter,consisting of a converging portion followed by a throat of constant diameter and then gradually diverging portion,is used to detremine the flow of  
      the pipe.The diameter at section 1 is 6 in. and that of section 2 is 4 in.,Find the discharge through the pipe when p1-p2=3psi and oil of sp grvty 0.9 is flo 
      wing                                                                                                                                                          
 
 Solution:   
 
 From the continuity equation Q=A1v1=A2v2   
 
 Therefore,v1=Q*16/pi , v2=Q*36/pi   
 
 And moreover Z1=Z2   
 
 Therefore discharge Q =
