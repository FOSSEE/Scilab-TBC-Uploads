 
 With regard to Example 1.4 suppose the  
      cylinder is a water quality sample 
       bottle used to collect water samp 
      les at a predetermined depths.At d 
      eep Depths the sample Bottle has a 
       smaller volume to collect 995 cm^ 
      3 due to compression.Suppose that  
      analysis reveals that 15 mg of sed 
      iment are collected.What would be  
      the difference in concerntration d 
      ata measured shipboard where the p 
      ressure is atmospheric versus the  
      in situ depths where the sample wa 
      s collected?                       
 
 Solution:   
 
 Concerntration of shipboard   
 
    0.015  
 
 mg/cm^3   
 
 Concerntration of in situ depth   
 
    0.0150754  
 
 mg/cm^3
