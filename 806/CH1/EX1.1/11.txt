 
 a liquid has a viscosity of 0.005kg/m.s and density of 850kg/cm^3,calculate the kinematic viscosity in (a)SI units (b)USC units and (c)viscosity in USC units   
 
 Solution:   
 
 Kinematic viscosity in SI units=   
 
    0.0000059  
 
 m^2/s   
 
 Kinematic viscosity in USC units=   
 
    0.0000633  
 
 ft^2/s   
 
 viscosity in USC units   
 
    0.0001044  
 
 slug/ft.s
