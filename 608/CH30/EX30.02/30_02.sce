//Problem 30.02: Determine the current flowing in the 2 ohm resistor of the circuit shown in Figure 30.5 using Kirchhoffâ€™s laws. Find also the power dissipated in the 3 ohm resistance.

//initializing the variables:
V = 8; // in volts
R1 = 1; // in ohm
R2 = 2; // in ohm
R3 = 3; // in ohm
R4 = 4; // in ohm
R5 = 5; // in ohm
R6 = 6; // in ohm

//calculation:
//Currents and their directions are assigned as shown in Figure 30.6.
//Three loops are chosen since three unknown currents are required. The choice of loop directions is arbitrary. loop ABCDE, and loop EDGF and loop DCHG
//using kirchoff rule in 3 loops
//three eqns obtained
