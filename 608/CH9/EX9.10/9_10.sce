//Problem 9.10: An 8 H inductor has a current of 3 A flowing through it. How much energy is stored in the magnetic field of the inductor?

//initializing the variables:
L = 8; // in Henry
I = 3; // in Amperes

//calculation:
W = L*I*I/2

printf("\n\n Result \n\n")
printf("\n Energy stored, W = %.0f J\n",W)
