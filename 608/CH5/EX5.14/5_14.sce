//Problem 5.14: If three identical lamps are connected in parallel and the combined resistance is 150 ohms, find the resistance of one lamp.

//initializing the variables:
Rt = 150; // in ohms
n = 3; // no. of identical lamp

//calculation:
R = Rt*3 // (1/Rt)=(1/R)+(1/R)+(1/R)

printf("\n\nResult\n\n")
printf("\n Resistance %.0f Ohms\n",R)
