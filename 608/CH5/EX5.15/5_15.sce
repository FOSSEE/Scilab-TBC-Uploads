//Problem 5.15: Three identical lamps A, B and C are connected in series across a 150 V supply. State (a) the voltage across each lamp, and (b) the effect of lamp C failing.

//initializing the variables:
//series connection
n = 3; // no. of identical lamp
Vt = 150; // in volts

//calculation:
V = Vt/3 // Since each lamp is identical, then V volts across each.

printf("\n\nResult\n\n")
printf("\n Voltage across each resistor = %.0f Volts(V)",V)
