//Problem 2.05: A coil has a current of 50 mA flowing through it when the applied voltage is 12 V. What is the resistance of the coil?

//initializing the variables:
I = 0.050; // in Ampere
V = 12; // in Volts

//calculation:
R = V/I

printf("\n\nResult\n\n")
printf("\nResistance(R): %.0f Ohms\n",R)
