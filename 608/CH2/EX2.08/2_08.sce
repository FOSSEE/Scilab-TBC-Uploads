//Problem 2.08: A 100 W electric light bulb is connected to a 250 V supply. Determine (a) the current flowing in the bulb, and (b) the resistance of the bulb.

//initializing the variables:
P = 100; // in Watt
V = 250; // in Volts

//calculation:
I = P/V
R = V/I

printf("\n\nResult\n\n")
printf("\nCurrent(I): %.1f Ampere(A)",I)
printf("\nResistance(R): %.0f Ohms\n",R)
