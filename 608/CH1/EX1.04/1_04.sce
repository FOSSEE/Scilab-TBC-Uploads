//Problem 1.04: A portable machine requires a force of 200 N to move it. How much work is done if the machine is moved 20 m and what average power is utilized if the movement takes 25 s?

//initializing the variables:
F = 200; // in Newton
d = 20; // in m
t = 25; // in sec

//calculation:
W = F*d
P = W/t

printf("\n\nResult\n\n")
printf("\nPower: %.0f watt(W)\n",P)
