//Problem 24.05: A 200 V, 50 Hz supply is connected across a coil of negligible resistance and inductance 0.15 H connected in series with a 32 ohm resistor. Determine (a) the impedance of the circuit, (b) the current and circuit phase angle, (c) the p.d. across the 32 ohm resistor, and (d) the p.d. across the coil.
