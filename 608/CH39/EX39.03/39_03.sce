//Problem 39.03: A 2000 pF capacitor has an alternating voltage of 20 V connected across it at a frequency of 10 kHz. If the power dissipated in the dielectric is 500 Î¼W, determine (a) the loss angle, (b) the equivalent series loss resistance, and (c) the equivalent parallel loss resistance.

//initializing the variables:
P = 500E-6; // in Watt
C = 2000E-12; // in Farads
V = 20; // in Volts
f = 10000; // in Hz

//calculation: 
//power loss = w*C*V^2*tan(del)
//loss angle
del = atan(P/(2*%pi*f*V*V*C))
//for an equivalent series circuit,
//tan(del) = (Rs*w*Cs)
Cs = C
Rs = (tan(del))/(2*%pi*f*Cp)
//for an equivalent parallel circuit
//tan(del) = 1/(Rp*w*Cp)
Cp = C
Rp = 1/(2*%pi*f*Cp*tan(del))
