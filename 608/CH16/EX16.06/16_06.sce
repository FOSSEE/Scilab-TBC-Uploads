//Problem 16.06: A coil of inductance 159.2 mH and resistance 40 ohm is connected in parallel with a 30 Î¼F capacitor across a 240 V, 50 Hz supply. Calculate (a) the current in the coil and its phase angle, (b) the current in the capacitor and its phase angle, (c) the supply current and its phase angle,(d) the circuit impedance, (e) the power consumed, (f) the apparent power, and (g) the reactive power. Draw the phasor diagram.

//initializing the variables:
C = 30E-6; // in Farads
R = 40; // in Ohms
L = 159.2E-3; // in Henry
V = 240; // in Volts
f = 50; // in Hz

//calculation:
XL = 2*%pi*f*L
Z1 = (R^2 + XL^2)^0.5
ILR = V/Z1
phi1 = atan(XL/R)
phi1d = phi1*180/%pi
Xc = 1/(2*%pi*f*C)
Ic = V/Xc
phi2 = %pi/2
phi2d = phi2*180/%pi
Ih = ILR*cos(phi1) + Ic*cos(phi2)
Iv = -1*ILR*sin(phi1) + Ic*sin(phi2)
I = (Ih^2 + Iv^2)^0.5
phi = atan(abs(Iv)/Ih)
Z = V/I
P = V*I*cos(phi)
phid = phi*180/%pi
S = V*I
Q = V*I*sin(phi)
