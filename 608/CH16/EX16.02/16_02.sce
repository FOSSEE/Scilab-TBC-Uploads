//Problem 16.02: A 30 Î¼F capacitor is connected in parallel with an 80 ohms resistor across a 240 V, 50 Hz supply. Calculate (a) the current in each branch, (b) the supply current, (c) the circuit phase angle, (d) the circuit impedance, (e) the power dissipated, and (f) the apparent power.

//initializing the variables:
R = 80; // in Ohms
C = 30E-6; // in Farads
V = 240; // in Volts
f = 50; // in Hz

//calculation:
IR = V/R
Xc = 1/(2*%pi*f*C)
Ic = V/Xc
I = (IR^2 + Ic^2)^0.5
phi = atan(Ic/IR)
phid = phi*180/%pi
Z = V/I
P = V*I*cos(phi)
S = V*I
