//(9.15)  A convergingâ€“diverging nozzle operating at steady state has a throat area of 6.25 cm2 and an exit area of 15 cm2. Air enters the nozzle with a negligible velocity at a pressure of 6.8 bars and a temperature of 280 K. For air as an ideal gas with k = 1.4, determine the mass flow rate, in kg/s, the exit pressure, in bars, and exit Mach number for each of the five following cases. (a) Isentropic flow with M = 0.7 at the throat. (b) Isentropic flow with M = 1 at the throat and the diverging portion acting as a diffuser. (c) Isentropic flow with M = 1 at the throat and the diverging portion acting as a nozzle. (d) Isentropic flow through the nozzle with a normal shock standing at the exit. (e) A normal shock stands in the diverging section at a location where the area is 12.5 cm2. Elsewhere in the nozzle, the flow is isentropic.
