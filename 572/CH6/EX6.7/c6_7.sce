//(6.7)   An inventor claims to have developed a device requiring no energy transfer by work or heat transfer, yet able to produce hot and cold streams of air from a single stream of air at an intermediate temperature. The inventor provides steady-state test data indicating that when air enters at a temperature of 21C and a pressure of 5.1 bars, separate streams of air exit at temperatures of -18C and 79C, respectively, and each at a pressure of 1 bar. Sixty percent of the mass entering the device exits at the lower temperature. Evaluate the inventorâ€™s claim, employing the ideal gas model for air and ignoring changes in the kinetic and potential energies of the streams from inlet to exit.
