//(2.1)  A gas in a pistonâ€“cylinder assembly undergoes an expansion process for which the relationship between pressure and volume is given by p*(v^n) = constant.The initial pressure is 3 bar, the initial volume is 0.1 m3, and the final volume is 0.2 m3. Determine the work for the process,in kJ, if (a) n=1.5, (b) n=1.0,and (c) n=0.
