//(3.8) A pistonâ€“cylinder assembly contains 0.9 kg of air at a temperature of 300K and a pressure of 1 bar. The air is compressed to a state where the temperature is 470K and the pressure is 6 bars. During the compression, there is a heat transfer from the air to the surroundings equal to 20 kJ. Using the ideal gas model for air, determine the work during the process, in kJ.
