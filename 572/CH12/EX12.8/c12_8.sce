//(12.8)  An airâ€“water vapor mixture is contained in a rigid, closed vessel with a volume of 35 m3 at 1.5 bar, 120C, and psi =  10%. The mixture is cooled at constant volume until its temperature is reduced to 22C. Determine (a) the dew point temperature corresponding to the initial state, in C, (b) the temperature at which condensation actually begins, in C, and (c) the amount of water condensed, in kg.
