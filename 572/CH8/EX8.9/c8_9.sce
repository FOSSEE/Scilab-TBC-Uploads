//(8.9)  The condenser of Example 8.2 involves two separate water streams. In one stream a two-phase liquidâ€“vapor mixture enters at 0.008 MPa and exits as a saturated liquid at 0.008 MPa. In the other stream, cooling water enters at 15C and exits at 35C. (a) Determine the net rate at which exergy is carried from the condenser by the cooling water, in MW. Express this result as a percentage of the exergy entering the plant with the fuel. (b) Determine for the condenser the rate of exergy destruction, in MW. Express this result as a percentage of the exergy entering the plant with the fuel. Let T0 = 22C and p0 = 1 atm.
