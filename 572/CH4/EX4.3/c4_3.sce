// (4.3)   Steam enters a convergingâ€“diverging nozzle operating at steady state with p1 = 40 bar, T1=  400C, and a velocity of 10 m/s. The steam flows through the nozzle with negligible heat transfer and no significant change in potential energy. At the exit, p2 = 15 bar, and the velocity is 665 m/s. The mass flow rate is 2 kg/s. Determine the exit area of the nozzle, in m2.
