//(4.11)  A tank having a volume of 0.85 m3 initially contains water as a two-phase liquidâ€”vapor mixture at 260C and a quality of 0.7. Saturated water vapor at 260C is slowly withdrawn through a pressure-regulating valve at the top of the tank as energy is transferred by heat to maintain the pressure constant in the tank. This continues until the tank is filled with saturated vapor at 260C. Determine the amount of heat transfer, in kJ. Neglect all kinetic and potential energy effects.
