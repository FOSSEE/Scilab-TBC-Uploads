// (4.9)  A supply line carries a two-phase liquidâ€“vapor mixture of steam at 20 bars. A small fraction of the flow in the line is diverted through a throttling calorimeter and exhausted to the atmosphere at 1 bar. The temperature of the exhaust steam is measured as 120C. Determine the quality of the steam in the supply line.
