//(4.13)  An air compressor rapidly fills a .28m3 tank, initially containing air at 21C, 1 bar, with air drawn from the atmosphere at 21C, 1 bar. During filling, the relationship between the pressure and specific volume of the air in the tank is pv^1.4 = constant. The ideal gas model applies for the air, and kinetic and potential energy effects are negligible. Plot the pressure, in atm, and the temperature, in F, of the air within the tank, each versus the ratio m/m1, where m1 is the initial mass in the tank and m is the mass in the tank at time t > 0. Also, plot the compressor work input, in kJ, versus m/m1. Let m/m1 vary from 1 to 3.
