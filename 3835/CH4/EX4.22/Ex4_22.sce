z1=18.03 //z1=10+j15 converted to polar form also it is at angle 56.31
z2=32.02
z3=10.77
//ybc=1/zbc=(1/z2+1/z3)=1/32.02+1/10.77
//on performing the add operation we get the value of zbc as 8.159-j9.553 that is in rectangular form
printf("\n The value of zbc is 8.159-j9.553")
//thus total impedance between terminals A and C is given by zac=z1+zbc
