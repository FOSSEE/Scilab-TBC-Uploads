//VARIABLE INITIALIZATION
//star values ra, rc and rd
ra=2;                         //in Ohms
rc=4;                         //in Ohms
rd=3;                         //in Ohms

//SOLUTION
//converting star with points A, C and D into delta ACD

//delta values rac, rcd and rad

rcd=r/ra;
rad=r/rc;
req1=(r1*rad)/(r1+rad);        //equivalent resistance between A and D
req2=(r2*rcd)/(r2+rcd);        //equivalent resistance between C and D
req3=req1+req2;                //series combination of resistors
req4=(req3*rac)/(req3+rac);    //parallel combination of resistors
req5=req4+r3;
