//on joining centre of 3 anions,an equilateral triangle is formed and on joining centres of any anion and cation  a right angle triangle ABC os formed

//where AC=rc+ra

//and BC=ra

//m(angle (ACB))=30 degree

//therefore cos (30)=ra/(rc+ra)

//assume rc/ra=r

r=(1-cosd(30))/cosd(30)                 //by arrangimg terms we get value of r
