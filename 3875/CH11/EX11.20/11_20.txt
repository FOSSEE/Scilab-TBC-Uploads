The lattice parameter of sample A is=  0.367 nm
The lattice parameter of sample B is = 0.361 nm
The lattice parameter of sample B is the same as that of pure copper.Therefore sample B is high purity copper.The lattice parameter of sample is 1.75 percent higher than that of pure copper.Sample B is not pure and the presence of impurity atoms has caused strain in the crystal line.
