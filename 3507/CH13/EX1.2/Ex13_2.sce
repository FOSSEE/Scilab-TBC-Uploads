printf("i)Refering to the Thevenin circuit, we see that voltage source \nis short and resistances except Rc and Re are bypassed.\nThus dc load = Rc + Re \n\n")
printf("  Refering to ac equivalent circuit, Rc is parallel with Rl.\nThus ac load = Rc*Rl/(Rc+Rl) \n \n \n")
printf("ii)Since Vcc=Vce+Ic*(Rc+Re) we get \n max Vce = Vcc and max Ic = Vcc/(Rc+Re) \n \n \n")
printf("iii)On applying ac signal, collector current and collector emitter \nvoltage change about Q point.\nMaximum collector current = Ic.\nMaximum positive swing of ac collector emitter voltage = Ic*R_AC \n So total maximum collector emitter voltage = Vce+Ic*R_AC \n\nMaximum positive swing of ac collector current = Vce/R_AC so \nTotal maximum collector current = Ic+Vce/R_AC \n")
