printf("i) Class A amplifier means that it raises voltage level of signal and its \nmode of operation is such that collector current flows for whole input signal. \n \n")
printf("ii) Audio voltage amplifier means it raises voltage level of audio signal \nand its mode of operation is class A. \n \n")
printf("iii) Class B power amplifier means that it raises power level of signal and its \nmode of operation is such that collector current flows for half cycle of input signal only. \n \n")
printf("iv) Class A transformer coupled power amplifier means that power amplification \nis being done, coupling is by tranformer and mode of operation is class A. \n")
