printf(" i) if R2 is shorted, base will be grounded. It will be \n    left without forward bias and transistor \n    will be cutoff so output is zero.\n \n")
printf(" ii) if R2 is open,forward bias will be very high. The \n    collector current will be very high and collector \n    emitter voltage will be very low. \n \n")
printf(" iii) if R1 is shorted, transistor will be in saturation \n    due to excessive forward bias. The base will be at \n    Vcc and emitter will be slightly below Vcc.\n \n")
printf(" iv) if R1 is open, transistor will be without forward bias.\n    Hence transistor will be cutoff i.e. output will be zero. \n")
