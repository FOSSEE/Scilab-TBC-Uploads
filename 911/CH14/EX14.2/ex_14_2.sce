disp('We know that MSB of straight binary number is same as MSB of the Gray code equivalent. This can be passed on as such to the output. In that case, each memory location of the ROM needs to store only a three bit data as the fourth bit is available as such from the input. The required size of ROM is therefore 16*3. The three bit data to be programmed into 16 different memory locations of the ROM corresponding to address inputs of 0000 to 1111 in the same order would be 000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100, 101, 111, 110, 010, 011, 001, and 000.')
