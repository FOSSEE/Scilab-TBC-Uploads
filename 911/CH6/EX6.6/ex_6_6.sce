disp('The desired BCD adder is a cascaded arrangement of two stages of the type of BCD adder discussed in the previous pages. It follows the generalised cascaded arrangement for three digit BCD adder. The BCD adder can be used to add four bit BCD equivalents of two single digit decimal numbers. A cascaded arrangement of two such stages where the output C is fed to the CARRY-IN of the second stage. In terms of IC type numbersm IC 7483 can be used for four bit binary adders as shown, IC 7408 can be used for implementing the required four two input AND gates (IC 7408 is a quad two input AND), and IC 7432 can be used to implement the required two three input OR gates. IC 7432 is a quad two-input OR. Two input OR gates can be connected in cascade to get a three-input OR gate.')
