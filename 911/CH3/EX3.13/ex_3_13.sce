disp('The NAND gates are used in the circuit are open collector gates. Paralleling of the two NAND gates at the input leads to a WIRE AND connection. Therefore the logic expression at the point where the two outputs combine is given by the equation (AB)''.(CD)''. Using Demorgan''s theorem (AB)''.(CD)''=(AB+CD)''. The third NAND is wired as an inverter. Therefore the final output can be written as : Y = AB + CD')
