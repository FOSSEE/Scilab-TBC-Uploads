disp('A positive edge triggered D flip flop, as shown in figure can be used for the purpose. Waveform A is applied to the D input and waveform B is applied to the clock input. If we examine the two waveforms, we will find that, on every occurence of leading edge of waveform B, waveform A is in logic 1 state. Thus, the Q output in this case will always be in a logic 1 state')
