disp('When the ENABLE input is LOW, the upper AND gate is disabled(with its output going to logic 0) and the lower AND gate is enabled(with its output becoming the same as the Q output owing to the feedback). The NOR gate output in this case is Q'', which means that the Q output holds its state as long as the ENABLE input is LOW')
