-->//(Design against Fluctuating Load) Example 5.4
 
-->//Completely reversed axial load acting on the rod Pa (kN)

 Pa  =
 
    100.  
 
-->//Ultimate tensile strength of 40Cr1 Sut (N/mm2)
 
-->Sut = 550
 Sut  =

Diameter of the rod(d) = 43.032758 mm

Answer is slightly different because of use of equation 5.18
