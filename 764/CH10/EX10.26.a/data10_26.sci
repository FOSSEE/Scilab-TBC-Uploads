//(Springs) Example 10.26
//Belleville spring is compressed completely flat when it is subjected to force P (N)
P = 4500
//Maximum compressive stress sigma (N/m2)
sigma = 1375 * 10^6
//Ratio of outer to inner diameter of the washer r1
r1 = 1.75
//Ratio of height to thickess of the washer r2
r2 = 1.5
//Modulus of elasticity E (N/mm2)
E = 207000
//Poisson's ratio mu
mu = 0.3
