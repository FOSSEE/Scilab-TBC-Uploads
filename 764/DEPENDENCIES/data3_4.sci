//Basic centre distance between two bolts C mm
C = 50
//Basic diameter of bolt Db mm
Db = 12
//Refer tables 3.2 and 3.3a for tolerances of H11-d11 fit
//Upper deviation for bolt Ub mm
Ub = -0.050
//Lower deviation for bolt Lb mm
Lb = -0.160
//Basic diameter of hole Dh mm
Dh = 12
//Upper deviation for hole Uh mm
Uh = 0.110
//Lower deviation for hole Lh mm
Lh = 0.000
