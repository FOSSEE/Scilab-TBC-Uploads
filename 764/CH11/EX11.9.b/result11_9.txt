-->//(Friction Clutches) Example 11.9
 
-->//Torque transmitted by oil-immersed multi-disk clutch Mt (N-m)
 
-->Mt = 75
 Mt  =
 
    75.  
 
-->//Coefficient of friction between the asbestos lining and steel plate mu
 
-->mu = 0.1
 mu  =
 
    0.1  
 
-->//Permissible intensity of pressure on the asbestos lining Pa (kPa)
 
-->Pa = 500
 Pa  =
 
    500.  
 
-->//Outer diameter of the friction lining due to space limitations D (mm)
 
-->D = 100
 D  =
 
    100.  
 
 

Applying uniform-wear theory

Inner diameter of the friction disks(d) = 57.700000 mm

Total clamping force(P) = 1916.929151 N

The total number disks required(n) = 11.000000

6.00 plane steel disks and 5.00 steel disks with attached asbestos lining can be used or vice versa
