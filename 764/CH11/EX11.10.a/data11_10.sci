//Total power transmitted by the cone clutch kW
kW = 30
//Number of revolutions of the cone clutch per minute (n) rpm
n = 500
//Coefficient of friction for asbestos friction lining mu
mu = 0.2
//Permissible intensity of pressure Pa (MPa)
Pa = 0.35
//Semi-cone angle of the cone clutch alpha (degree)
alpha = 12.5
//Outer diameter of the cone clutch due to space limitations D (mm)
D = 300
