
//(Friction Clutches)Example 11.3
//The automotive plate clutch consists two pairs of contacting surfaces
//Total torque transmitting capacity of the clutch Mf (N-m)
Mt = 550 
//Coefficient of friction between clutch-pressure plate-flywheel mu
mu = 0.25
//Permissible intensity of pressure Pa (MPa)
Pa = 0.5
//Outer diameter of the friction disk due to space limitations D (mm)
D = 250
