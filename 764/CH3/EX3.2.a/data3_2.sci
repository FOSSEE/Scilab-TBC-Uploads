//Refer Fig. 3.26 on page 70
//Basic diameter of housing Dh mm
Dh = 20
//Refer tables 3.2 and 3.3b for tolerances of H7-s6 fit
//Upper deviation for housing Uh mm
Uh = 0.021
//Lower deviation for housing Lh mm
Lh = 0.000
//Basic diameter of valve seat(outer diameter) Dv mm
Dv = 20
//Upper deviation for valve seat Uv mm
Uv = 0.048
//Lower deviation for valve seat Lv mm
Lv = 0.035
