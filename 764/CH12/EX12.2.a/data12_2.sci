//Total mass of the car m (kg)
m = 1000
//Moment of inertia of each wheel about its transverse axis I (kg-m2)
I = 0.5
//Rolling radius of the wheel R (m)
R = 0.35
//Moment of inertia of other parts of the car Ie (kg-m2)
Ie = 2.5
//Ratio of speed of engine to the speed of wheels r
r = 5
//Speed of the car v1 (km/h)
v1 = 100
//Car deceleration dec (m/s2)
dec = 0.5 * 9.81
//Final speed of the car v2 (km/h)
v2 = 0
//Number of wheels n
