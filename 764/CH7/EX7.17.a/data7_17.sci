//Refer Fig. 7.36 on page 257
//Pre-load in the bolt Pi (kN)
Pi = 2.5
//External force acting on the bolt P (kN)
P = 5
//Yield tensile strength of 30C8 Syt (N/mm2)
Syt = 400
//Factor of safety fs
fs = 2.5
//Assume stiffness of bolts to be 1N/mm kb
kb = 1
//Stiffness of parts held together kc (N/mm)
kc = 2.5 * kb
