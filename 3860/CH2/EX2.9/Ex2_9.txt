 
 Z2 = A'BCD + AB'CD + ABC'D + ABCD' + ABCD

 the last terms ABCD can be combined with each of the others. Thus, if we make four copies of it and then utilize for times we obtain

 Z2 = BCD + ACD + ABD + ABC

 No further simplification is possible; this is minimum SOP form

 Z1 = A'BCD + AB'CD + ABC'D + ABCD' 

 In case of Z1 no simplification is possible it has 16 literals whereas expression for Z2 only has 12 literals.
