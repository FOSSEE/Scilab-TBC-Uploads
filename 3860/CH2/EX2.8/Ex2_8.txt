 
 f(a,b,c) = Summation minterms (1,2,5) + Summation dont cares (0,3)

 implies that minterms 1,2 and 5 are included in the function and that 0 and 3 are dont cares, that is the truth table is as follows:

 a  b  c  |    f

 0  0  0  |    x

 0  0  1  |    1

 0  1  0  |    1

 0  1  1  |    x

 1  0  0  |    0

 1  0  1  |    1

 1  1  0  |    0

 1  1  1  |    0
