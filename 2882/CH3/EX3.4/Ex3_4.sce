//Given Data

Rl=2D3;//Load resistance in ohms
esp=50;//Input signal voltage magnitude in volts peak
esf=314/(2*%pi);//Input signal frequncy in hertz
Vr_to_Vdc=6/100;//Ratio of peak to peak ripple voltage to d.c. output voltage

//Solution

//Using figure E3.4
//From right angled triangle pqr
