VCC=15;//supply voltage in volts
RB=330D3;//base resistance in ohms
RL=2D3;//load collector resistance in ohms
RE=820;//emitter resistance in ohms
B=75;//DC CE current gain beta
VBE=0.7;//forward voltage drop of emitter diode in volts
Cb=12D-6;//base coupling capacitor in farads
Ce=50D-6;//emitter bypass capacitor in farads
