//the eutectoidal mixture of pearlite consists of two phases viz. alpha (ferrite) and Fe3C (cementite). the eutectoid composition contains 0.83% carbon. the lever rule is applied in which the lever arm has ferrite (=0% carbon) at one end and cementite  (6.67% carbon) at the other end. the fulcrum is taken at 0.83% carbon. hence by applying lever rule, we get
Walpha=(6.67-0.83)/(6.67-0.00)
WFe3C=(0.83-0.0)/(6.67-0.0)
printf ("the weight fractions of ferrite and cementite are %f and %f resp",Walpha,WFe3C)
