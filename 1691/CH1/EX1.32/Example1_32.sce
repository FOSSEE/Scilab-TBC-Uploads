disp("Voltage series feedback is the most commonly used feedback arrangement in cascaded amplifier. Voltage series feedback increases input resistance and decreases output resistance. Increase in input resistance reduces the loading effect of previous stage and decreses in output resistance reduces the loading effect of amplifier itself for driving the next stage.")
