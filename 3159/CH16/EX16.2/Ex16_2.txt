
 Example 16.2
 Part A:
 At 0 K, Net magnetic moment of gadolinium i.e. 7 is greater than net magnetic moment of cobalt i.e. 1.7 
 So, Gd will have higher saturation magnetization

 Part B:
 At temperature 300 K, Gd is above its curie temperature of 289K
 Gd will be paramagnetic at 300 K and will have negligible magnetization
 as compared to Co, which has higher curie temperature
