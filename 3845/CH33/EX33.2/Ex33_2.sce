//Example 33.2
//V_gap=Sum of gap voltages/Number of gaps
//Sum of gap voltages=800MV, since to produce a 800MeV proton beam, the proton gains 1eV per volt across each gap it passes through
//Number of gaps=2000
V_gap=800*10^6/2000;
printf('The average voltage to be applied between the tubes = %d kV',V_gap/1000)
