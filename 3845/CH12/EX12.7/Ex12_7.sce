//Example 12.7
//Deriving from Poiseuille's law and considering flow rate has halved [Q2=0.5Q1], we get
//(r2/r1)^4=Q2/Q1
//r2/r1=(0.5)^1/4;
ratio=(0.5)^(1/4);
printf('The radius of the coronary artery after plaque deposits is %0.3f times the initial radius,\na decrease of %0.2f%%',ratio,[(1-ratio)/1*100])
//The answer varies due to round off error
