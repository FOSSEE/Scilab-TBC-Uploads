//Example 12.4
P2=1.01*10^5;//Absolute pressure in the nozzle (N/m^2)
v1=1.96;//Speed of water in the hose (m/s)
v2=25.5;//Speed of water in the nozzle (m/s)
rho=10^3;//Density of water (kg/m^3)
P1=P2+1/2*rho*(v2^2-v1^2);//Abolute pressure in the hose from Bernoulli's equation (N/m^2)
printf('Absolute pressure in the hose = %0.2e N/m^2',P1)
