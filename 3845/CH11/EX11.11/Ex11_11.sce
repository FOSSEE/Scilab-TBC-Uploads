//Example 11.11
r=2*10^-4;//Radius of soap bubble (m)
Gamma=0.037;//Surface tension of soapy water (N/m), See Table 11.3
P=4*Gamma/r;//Gauge pressure inside the soap bubble (Pa)
printf('Gauge pressure inside the soap bubble = %0.1f Pa',P)
P1=P*1/133;//Gauge pressure inside the soap bubble (mm Hg)
printf('\nGauge pressure inside the soap bubble = %0.2f mm Hg',P1)
