//Example 4.2
m=2100;//Mass of the system (kg)
a=49;//Initial acceleration (m/s^2)
f=650;//Frictional force (N)
T=(m*a+f)/4;//Thrust exerted by each rocket (N), See Equation 4.14
//There are 4 rockets. Net horizontal force F_net=m*a (N)
printf('Individual thrust exerted by each rocket = %0.1e N',T)
