//Example 1.4
vol_stack=6*3*0.5;//Volume of a stack of 100 bills(in^3)=length(in)*width(in)*height(in)
n_stacks=(1*10^12)/(1*10^4);//Number of stacks=(1 trillion $)/(dollars in a stack of 100$ bills)
area=100*50*(3/1)*(3/1)*(12/1)*(12/1);//Area of football field (in^2)=length(yards)*width(yards)*conversion sq.yards to sq.in
tot_vol=vol_stack*n_stacks;//Total volume of bills (in^3)
height=tot_vol/area;//Height of bills (in)
