//Example 19.2
delta_PE=-30;//Energy lost per second (J)
delta_V=12;//Potential difference (V)
q=delta_PE/delta_V;//Charge moved (C)
n_e=q/(-1.60*10^-19);//Number of electrons passing per second
//-1.60*10^-19 C is the charge of an electron
printf('Number of electrons passing per second = %0.2e',n_e)
