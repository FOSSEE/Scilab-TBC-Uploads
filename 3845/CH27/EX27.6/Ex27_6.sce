//Example 27.6
lambda=550*10^-9;//Wavelength of light (m)
n2=1.38;//Index of refraction of magnesium fluoride film
lambda_n_2=lambda/n2;//Wavelength in the film (m)
//For destructive interference here, 2t=lambda_n_2/2, where path length difference=2t for perpendicularly incident rays
t=lambda_n_2/4;//Thickness of the film (m)
printf('Thickness of the magnesium fluoride film = %0.1f nm',t/10^-9)
