(i) V1 = 1.00 V 
V2 = 1.20 V 
V3 = 1.64 V 
V4 = 2.41 V 

Voltage across the string = 6.25 V 
The voltage across each unit expressed as a percentage becomes: 
	 Top unit = 16.01 % 
	 Second from top = 19.21 % 
	 Third from top = 26.25 % 
	 Fourth from top = 38.54 % 

(ii) String efficiency = 64.87 %
