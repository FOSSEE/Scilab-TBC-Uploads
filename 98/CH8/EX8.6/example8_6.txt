(i) Voltage across top unit = 1.00 V 
Voltage across second unit = 1.10 V 
Voltage across third unit = 1.31 V 
Voltage across fourth unit = 1.65 V 

Voltage across the string = 5.06 V 
The voltage across each unit expressed as a percentage becomes: 
	 Top unit = 19.76 % 
	 Second from top = 21.74 % 
	 Third from top = 25.89 % 
	 Fourth from top = 32.61 % 

(ii) String efficiency = 76.67 %
