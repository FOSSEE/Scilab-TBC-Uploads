(i) Total impedance to any sequence current is sum of generator and feeder impedances of that sequence currents 
	Total Z(1) = j(2.2) ohm 
	Total Z(2) = j(1.9) ohm 
	Total Z(3) = j(3.4) ohm 
I1 = I2 = I0 = j(-846) A 

Fault current = j(-2540) A 


(ii) Line to nuetral voltage of R-phase = 4233.90 V
