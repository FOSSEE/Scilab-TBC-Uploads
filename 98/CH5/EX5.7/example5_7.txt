Let L be the load factor
DIESEL STATION: 
Average power = 0.0114 kW 
Maximum demand = 0.0114/L kW 
Fixed charges = Rs. 3.42/L 
Running charges = Rs. 25.00 
Fixed and running charges = Rs. (3.42/L + 25.00) 

STEAM STATION: 
Fixed charges = Rs. 13.70/L 
Running charges = Rs. 6.25 
Fixed and running charges = Rs. (13.70/L + 6.25) 

Equating the two charges and solving, we get L = 54.72 %
