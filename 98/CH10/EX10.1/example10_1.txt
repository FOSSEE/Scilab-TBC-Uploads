Line current = 41.67 A 
             = 33.33+j(-25.00) 

(i) Sending end voltage = 33708.33+j(250.00) 
    Magnitude of Vs = 33709 V 

(ii) Angle betwen Vs and Vr = 0.42 degrees 
     Sending end power factor angle = 37.29 degrees 
     Sending end power factor = 0.80 

(iii) Line loss = 17.36 kW 
      Output delivered = 1100 kW 
      Power sent = 1117.361 kW 
      Transmission efficiency = 98.45 %
