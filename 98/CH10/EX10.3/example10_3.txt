Impedance per phase = 4+j(6) 

Line current = 164.02 A 

             = 131.22+j(-98.41) 

(i) Sending end voltage phasor =13817.04+j(393.65) 

    Magnitude of Vs = 13822.65 V 

    Line value of Vs = 23.94 kV 

(ii) Percentage regulation = 8.825 % 

(iii) Line losses = 322.831 kW 

      Transmission efficiency = 93.93 %
