(i) Phase voltage = 230.94 V 
	 Ir = 43.3 A 
	 Iy = 34.6 A 
	 Ib = 21.7 A 
(ii) The three line currents are different in magnitude and displaced by 120 degrees from one another. Resolving currents on x and y axis:
	 Resultant horizontal component = 11.2 A 
	 Resultant vertical component = 15.2 A 
	 Current in nuetral wire = 18.9 A
