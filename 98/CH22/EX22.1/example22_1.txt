Voltage per phase = 3811 V 

Full load current = 875 V 

Reactance per phase = 0.436 ohm 

Reactance of 10 percent winding = 0.0436 ohm 

EMF induced in 10 percent winding = 381 V 

Impedance offered by fault by 10 percent winding is Zf=sqrt(0.0436^2+r^2) 

Earthing resistance to be provided = 2.177 ohm
