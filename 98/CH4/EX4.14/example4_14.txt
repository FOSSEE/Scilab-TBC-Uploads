MAximum demand = 150 MW 
STEAM PLANT: 
Capital cost = Rs. 240*10^6 
Annual interest = Rs. 16.80*10^6 
Fixed cost/unit = Rs. 16.80*10^6/x 
Running cost/unit = Rs. 0.06 
Total cost/unit = Rs. 16.80*10^6/x+0.06 

HYDRO PLANT: 
Capital cost = Rs. 450*10^6 
Annual interest = Rs. 31.50*10^6 
Fixed cost/unit = Rs. 31.50*10^6/x 
Running cost/unit = Rs. 0.03 
Total cost/unit = Rs. 31.50*10^6/x+0.03 

By equating the overall cost, we get x = 490000000.00 kWh 
Load factor = 37.29 %-->diary(0)
