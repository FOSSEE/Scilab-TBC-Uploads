Current on +ve outer = 60 A 
Current on -ve outer = 40 A 
Current in nuetral = 20 A 

Voltage at the load end on the +ve side = 252.00 V 
Voltage at the load end on the -ve side = 243.00 V 


 
 (i) WHEN NUETRAL BREAKS:    
Total circuit resistance = 10.3 ohm 
Load current = 48.06 A 
Voltage across 4 ohm resistance = 192.23 V 
Voltage across 6 ohm resistance = 288.35 V 

 
 (ii) WHEN +VE OUTER BREAKS:    
Total circuit resistance = 6.3 ohm 
Load current = 38.57 A 
Voltage across 6 ohm resistance = 231.43 V 

 
 (iii) WHEN -VE OUTER BREAKS:    
Total circuit resistance = 4.3 ohm 
Load current = 58.60 A 
Voltage across 4 ohm resistance = 234.42 V
