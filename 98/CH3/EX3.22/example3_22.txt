Units generated per annum = 2102.40*10^6 kW 

Units generated by steam plant = 1226.40*10^6 kWh 
Units generated by run of river plant = 700.80*10^6 kWh 
Units generated by reservoir plant = 175.20*10^6 kWh 

(i) Maximum demand of run of river plant = 80000 kW 
    Maximum demand of reservoir plant = 80 MW 
    Maximum demand of steam plant = 160 MW 

(ii) Load factor of run of river plant = 100 %
     Load factor of reservoir plant = 25 %
     Load factor of steam plant = 87.50 %
