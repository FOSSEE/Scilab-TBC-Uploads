 
 COST OF INCREASING PLANT CAPACITY:    
The initial capacity of the plant is OB kVA at pf = pf1 

The increase in kVA capacity of the plant = 0.2143*OB 

Total cost of increasing the plant capacity = Rs. 171.43*OB 

 
 COST OF POWER FACTOR CORRECTION EQUIPMENT:    
Leading kVAR taken by p.f correction equipment = 0.34*OB 

Let the cost per kVAR of the equipment be Rs. y 

Total cost of p.f correction equipment = Rs. 0.34*y*OB 

Equating the total cost, y = Rs. 503.6
