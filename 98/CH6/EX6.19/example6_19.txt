 
 COST OF INCREASING PLANT CAPACITY:    
The increase in kVA capacity of the plant = 0.2371*OB 

Total cost of increasing the plant capacity = Rs. 2.37*OB 

 
 COST OF PHASE ADVANCING EQUIPMENT:    
Leading kVAR taken by p.f correction equipment = 0.383*OB 

Let the cost per kVAR of the equipment be Rs. y 

Annual cost of phase advancing equipment = Rs. 0.038*y*OB 

Equating the total costs for economy, y = Rs. 61.84
