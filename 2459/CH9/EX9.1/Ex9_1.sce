printf("in fig. (i), the conventional current coming out of battery flows in the \nbranch circuits. In diode D1,the conventional current flows in the \ndirection of arrowhead and hence this diode is forward biased. \nHowever in diode D2, the conventional current flows opposite \nto arrowhead and hence this diode is reverse biased.\n \n")
printf("in fig. (ii), During the positive half cycle of input ac voltage, the \nconventional current flows in the direction of arrowhead and hence diode \nis forward biased. However, during the negative half cycle \nof input ac voltage, the diode is reverse biased.\n \n")
printf("in fig. (iii), During the positive half cycle of input ac voltage, the \nconventional current flows in the direction of arrowhead in D1 but it flows \nopposite to arrowhead in D2. So during positive half cycle, \ndiode D1 is forward biased and diode D2 is reverse biased. \nHowever in the negative half cycle of the input ac voltage, diode D2 \nis forward biased and diode D1 is reverse biased.\n \n")
printf("in fig. (iv),  During the positive half cycle of input ac voltage, \nboth diodes are reverse biased. However in the negative half cycle of the \ninput ac voltage, both diodes are forward biased.\n \n")
