
 Part a   
 
 the voltage (in V) across the 200 W , 120 V bulb is   
 
    80.  
 
 the voltage (in V) across the 100 W , 120 V bulb is   
 
    160.  
 
 Part b   
 
 the power dissipated (in W) by the 200 W , 120 V bulb is   
 
    88.888889  
 
 the power dissipated (in W) by the 100 W , 120 V bulb is   
 
    177.77778  
 
 Part c   
 
 the 200 W bulb will be approximately half as bright as normal , the 10 W bulb would be much brighter (almost twice as bright) than normal and would probably burn o 
      ut in few minutes
