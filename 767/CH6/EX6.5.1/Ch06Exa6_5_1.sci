v = 2.999999997e+08;  //  Velocity of the electron, m/s
c = 3e+08;  // Velocity of light,m/s
D = c-v; // difference between electron's speed and speed of light,m/s
printf("\nThe difference between electron speed and speed of light : %3.1f m/s", D);
// Result
//  The difference between electron speed and speed of light : 0.3 m/s
