//variable declaration

// Let the force shared by bolt be Ps and that by tube be Pc. Since there is no external force, static equilibrium condition gives Ps + Pc = 0 or Ps = â€“ Pc i.e., the two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in nature. Obviously bolt is in tension and tube is in compression.
//Let the magnitude of force be P. Due to quarter turn of the nut

//[Note. Pitch means advancement of nut in one full turn]
