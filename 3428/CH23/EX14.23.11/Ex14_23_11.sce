//To find the concentration of Ag+ ions at which I- and Cl- ions will precipitate.
clc,
Ksp_AgI=1.5*10^-16
Ksp_AgCl=1.56*10^-10
C=Ksp_AgI/Ksp_AgCl
disp(C,'concentration of Ag+ ions at which I- and Cl- ions will precipitate')
//Answer in the book is  9.6*10^-7 approximately equal to 0.0000010.
