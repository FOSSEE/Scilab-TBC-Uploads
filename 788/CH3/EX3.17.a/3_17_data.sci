// Aim:Refer Example 3-17 for Problem Description. 
// Given:
// Pump Power:
HHP=3.73; //kW
// Pump flow:
Q=0.001896; //m^3/s
// Pipe Diameter:
D=0.0254; //m
// specific gravity of oil:
SG=0.9;
// Pressure at Station 1:
p1=0; //Pa (It is atmospheric pressure.)
// Elevation Between Station 1 and 2:
// Z=Z1-Z2
Z=-6.096; //m   -ve sign indicates Station 2 is above Station 1
// Head Loss due to friction between Station 1 and 2 of oil:
Hl=9.144; //m
