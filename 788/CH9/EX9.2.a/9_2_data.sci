// Aim:Refer Example 9-2 for Problem Description 
// Given:
// force required for sheet metal punching operations:
F_load=2000; //lb
// piston diameter:
Dp=1.5; //in
// rod diameter:
Dr=0.5; //in
// frictional pressure loss in line from high-flow pump to blank end during rapid extension:
p_loss1=100; //psi
// frictional pressure loss in return line from rod end to oil tank during rapid extension:
p_loss2=50; //psi
