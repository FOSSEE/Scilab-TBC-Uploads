 From equation the offset voltage is Vth. 
Vth = -0.030864 V  
We next find the bridge Thevenin Resistance form equation as : Rth = 2012.345679 ohm 
Finally the current is given by the equation Ig = -0.000015 Ampere 
The negative sign on current simply means that current flows fromright to left.
