 First,for the nominal resistance values given, 
 the bridge is set at anull with I=0,because
Va = 0.909091 V 
With I=0 we get 
Vb = 0.909091 V 
When R3 increases by 1 ohm to 1001 ohm, Va becomesVa = 1.666667 V 
which shows that the voltage at b must increase by 0.0008 V to renull the bridge.
This can be proved by current,from equation and Delta V=0,found from 
I = 0.000016 A
