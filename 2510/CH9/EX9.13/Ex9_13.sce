//Variable declaration:
//From example 9.7:
h = 38.7                    //Average heat transfer coefficient (W/m^2.K)
L = 1.2                     //Length of plate (m)
k = 0.025                   //Thermal conductivity of air (W/m)

//Calculation:
Bi = h*L/k                  //Average Biot number

//Result:
printf("The average Biot number is : %.0f ",Bi)
