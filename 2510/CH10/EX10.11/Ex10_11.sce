//Variable declaration:
//From example 10.9-10.10:
Q = 8.36                        //Heat transfer lost by free convection from light bulb (W)

//Calculation:
E = Q/100.0*(100.0)             //Percent energy lost by free convection (%)

//Result:
printf("The percentage of the energy lost by free convection is : %.2f  %%.",E)
printf("The energy lost fraction is : %.4f .",E/100.0)
