//Variable declaration:
//From example 11.6-11.7:
E1 = 8776.0                     //Energy exchange between black bodies (Btu/h.ft^2)
E2 = 3760.0                     //Energy exchange between non-black bodies (Btu/h.ft^2)

//Calculation:
D = (E1-E2)/E1*100              //Percent difference in energy (%)

//Result:
printf("The percent difference relative to the black body is: %.1f %%.",D)
