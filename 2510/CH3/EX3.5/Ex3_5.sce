//Variable declaration:
SG = 0.92               //Specific gavity of liquid, methanol
DW = 62.4               //Density of reference substance, water (lb/ft^3)
 
//Calculation:
DM = SG*DW              //Density of methanol (lb/ft^3)
 
//Result:
disp("Density of methanol is:")
disp(DM)
disp("lb/ft^3")
