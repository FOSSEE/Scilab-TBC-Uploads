//Variable declaration:
NPS = 2                     //Nominal pipe size (inch)
SN = 40                     //Schedule number

//Calculation:
//From Table 6.2, we obtain that the inside diameter of steel pipe is ID = 2.067 in.
ID = 2.067

//Result:
printf("The inside diameter of steel pipe is : %f in.",ID)
