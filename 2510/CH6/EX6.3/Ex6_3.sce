//Variable declaration:
ID = 0.957                  //Inside diameter of pipe (in)
OD = 1.315                  //Outside diameter of pipe (in)
WT = 0.179                  //Wall thickness of pipe (in)
PW = 2.17                   //Weight of pipe (lb/ft)

//Calculation:
//From Table 6.2, it indicates that the steel pipe is 1 inch schedule 80.
NSP = 1
SN = 80

//Result:
printf("The nominal size of the pipe is : %f in.",NSP)
printf("The schedule number of the pipe is: %f .",SN)
