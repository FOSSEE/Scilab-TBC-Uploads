//Variable declaration:
//From example 13.11:
W_in = 40.0                  //Change in enthalpy across the compressor (kJ/kg)
QC = 160.0                   //Heat absorbed by the evaporator (kJ/kg)

//Calculation:
COP = QC/W_in               //Refrigeratorâ€™s C.O.P.

//Result:
printf("the refrigerators C.O.P. is : %.0f .",COP)
