//Variable declaration:
//Fro example 18.20:
V = 7335                    //Volume of tank (ft^3)

//Calculation:
D = (4*V/%pi)**(1/3)         //Diameter of tank (ft)
H = D                       //Height of tube (ft)

//Result:
printf("The diameter of tank is : %.2f ft .",H)
printf("The height of tube is : %.2f ft .",D)
