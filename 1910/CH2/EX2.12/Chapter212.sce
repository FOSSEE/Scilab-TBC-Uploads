//A spherical tank of internal diameter, Di=5m ,made of t=25mm thick stainless steel(thermal conductivity,k=15W/(m*K)),is used to store water at temprature(Ti)=0째C.Do is outer diameter
Di=5;
t=25;
Do=5+2*(t/1000);//in metre
k=15;
Ti=0;
//The tank is located in a room whose temprature is (To)=20째C.
To=20;
//Emmisivity is 1.
//The convection heat transfer coefficients at the inner and outer surfaces of the tank are hi=80W/(m^2*K) and ho=10W/(m^2*K)
hi=80;
ho=10;
//The heat of fusion of ice at atmospheric pressure is deltahf=334kJ/kg.The stefan-boltzman constant(sigma) is 5.67*10^-8W/m^2.
sigma=5.67*10^-8;
deltahf=334;
//The inner surface area is (A1) and outer surface area is (A2)of the tank

//The individual thermal resistances can be determined as
//The convective resistance is (Ri)

Ri=1/(hi*A1)

Rs=(Do-Di)/(2*k*%pi*Di*Do)
//The convective resistance is(Roc)
disp("The convective resistance(Roc) at the outer surface in K/W is")
Roc=1/(ho*A2)
//The radiative resistance(Ror) at the outer surface is Ror=1/(A2*hr) 
//The radiative heat transfer coefficient hr is determined by hr=sigma*(T2^2+293.15^2)*(T2+293.15)
//But we do not know the outer surface temprature T2 of the tank and hence we cannot determine the value of hr.
//Therfore we adopt an iterative procedure.We assume T2=4째C=277.15K.Putting the value in hr=sigma*(T2^2+293.15^2)*(T2+293.15) we get
T2=277.15;

Ro=1/X
//Now the resistance Ri,Rs and Ro are in series an hence the total resistance becomes Rtotal=Ri+Rs+Ro

Rtotal=Ri+Rs+Ro 
//The rate of heat transfer is given by Q=(To-Ti)/Rtotal

Q=(To-Ti)/Rtotal
//The outer surface(T2) is calculated as T2=To-Q*Ro
