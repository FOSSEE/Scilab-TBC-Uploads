//An iron beam of rectangular cross section of size length,L=300mm by breadth,B=200 mm is used in the construction of a building
//Initially the beam is at a uniform temprature(Ti) of 30째C.
//Due to an accidental fire,the beam is suddenly exposed to hot gases at temprature,Tinf=730째C,with a convective heat transfer coefficient(h) of 100 W/(m^2*K)
//To determine the time required for the centre plane of the beam to reach a temprature(To) of 310째C.
To=310;
Tinf=730;
Ti=30;
//Take thermal conductivity k=73W/(m*K) and thermal diffusivity of the beam alpha=2.034*10^-5m^2/s 
alpha=2.034*10^-5;

//The rectangular iron beam can be considered as an intersection of an infinite plate 1 having thickness 2*L1=300mm and a second infinite plate 2 of thickness 2*L2=200mm 
L1=0.15;//in metre
L2=0.10;//in metre
//Here the faactor X=((To-Tinf)/(Ti-Tinf))

X=((To-Tinf)/(Ti-Tinf))
//Therefore we can write 0.6=((To-Tinf)/(Ti-Tinf))plate 1 *((To-Tinf)/(Ti-Tinf))plate2
//A straight forward solution is not possible.We have to adopt an iterative method of solution 
//At first ,a value of time(t) is assumed to determine the centre-line temprature of the beam.The value of t at which((To-Tinf)/(Ti-Tinf))beam =0.6 is satisfied
//Let us first assume time, t=900s

//At Fo=0.814 and (1/Bi)=4.87...We read from graphs  A=((To-Tinf)/(Ti-Tinf))plate1= 0.85

//Since the calculated value of 0.68 is greater than the required value of 0.60 and Tinf>To>Ti,The assume dvalue of t is less.
