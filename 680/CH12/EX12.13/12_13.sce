printf("\n Combining the curves generated from both methods into one figure (see Fig. 12.14), \n it can be observed that the plot generated using Raoult’s law gives lower values \n of pressure at the same xm values that the NRTL method gives for higher values. Also the \n bubble point curve from Raoult’s law is (as expected) a straight line compared to the curve generated \n by the NRTL method, which is concave down.")
