//Problem 9.07:

//initializing the variables:

//calculation:
//Since enthalpy is a point function, it is reasonable to assume that the temperature effects are additive. Therefore, the temperature increases are:
//Scenario 1: DT = DT1.5 - DT0.0
DT1 = 10 - 0 
//Scenario 2: DT = DT3.0-DT1.5
DT2 = 15 - 10
