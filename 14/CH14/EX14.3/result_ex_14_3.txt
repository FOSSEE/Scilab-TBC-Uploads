 The terminal voltage after considering the angle is,in per unit   
 
    0.9539392 + 0.3i  
 
 The output current from the generator in per unit is   
 
    1. + 0.153536i  
 
 The transient internal voltage in per unit   
 
    0.923232 + 0.5i  
 
 Power angle equation is   

 Pe = 2.10 * sin(delta) 
 where delta is the machine rotor angle wrt to the infinite bus
