////Given
m=10*10**-3                                        //mass of a ball in kg 
v=1                                                //Speed in m/s
h=6.63*10**-34                                     //Js

//Calculation
V=h/(m*v)                                          //Wavelength

//Result
printf("\n de broglie wavelength is  %e m",V)
printf("\n This wavelength is negligible compared to the dimensions of the ball. therefore its effect can not be observed.")
