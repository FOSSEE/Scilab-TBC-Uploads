//Air flowing at high speed in a wind tunnel has a pressure and temperature equal to 0.3 atm and -100 degree celcius,respectively.what is specific volme?
//1 atm=1.01*10^5 Pa or N/m^2
P=.3*1.01*10^5;//in N/m^2
//0 degree=273 Kelvin
T=-100+273;//in Kelvin
R=287;//gas constant for air.(j/kg.k)
density=P/(R*T)
v=1/density
