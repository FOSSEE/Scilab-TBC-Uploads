//datas are all taken from standard table of variation of temperature,pressure and density with height.
//Pressure at the flying altitude:
P=4.72*10^4;//in N/m^2
P1=6;//height corresponding to pressure P in Km
//Temperature at the flying altitude:
T=255.7;//in Kelvin
T1=5//height corresponding to temperature T in Km
D=P/(R*T)//density at that height
D1=6.24//height corresponding to density D in Km
