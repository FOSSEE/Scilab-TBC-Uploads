==========================================================
The value of apparent kLa: 5.74 (sec-1)
 The value of predicted kLa: 0.28 (sec-1)
The absorption of oxygen is greatly enhanced by chemical reactions in the liquid film
The kinetics can be approximated by a first-order expression,the reaction would fall in the pseudo-first-order regime,
where the rate varies with the square root of the oxygen diffusivity and the rate constant.


 OUTPUT Ex7.7.b
==========================================================
The value of Phi (enhancement factor) 7.0047E+04 
The value of ratio Phi_a_by_Phi:3.5E+03
From the ratio value Phi_a is greater than Phi hence there is no significant gradient for cyclohexane
