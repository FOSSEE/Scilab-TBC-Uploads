==========================================================
	The Apparent rate constants are 
	 Run1 1.96 hr-1 
	 Run2 1.27 hr-1  
	The exponent value = 0.7 hence the difference is not consistent with repect to equations (8.23) and (8.24)for the  apparent rate constants obtained
	The error may be due to error in assuming a first order reaction


 OUTPUT Ex8.3.b
==========================================================
	The internal effectiveness factor based on Sulphur and Hydrogen diffusion are 2.06 and 0.28 respectively
	The internal effectiveness factor based on Hydrogen is negligible
