//to find speed of ball

// GIVEN:
//refer to figure 12-6 on page no. 263
//lift of car
y = 25//in meters
//acceleration due to gravity
g = 9.8//in m/s^2 

// SOLUTION:
//applying conservation of energy principle
//speed of car
v = sqrt(2*g*y)//in m/s 
printf ("\n\n Speed of car v = \n\n %2i m/s",v)
