//Initilization of variables
N=4/3 //Normal reaction after solving without the mg term in it
u_N=1/2 //Frictional force without the mg term in it
//Calculations
u=u_N/N //Coefficient of friction
//Result
clc
printf("The frictional co-efficient is %f",u)
//The answer in the textbook and the code differs due to multiplication of fractions
