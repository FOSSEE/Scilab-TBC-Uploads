// Solution

//The Mollier chart has lines of constant moisture in the wet region which correspond to (1-x).Therefore,we read at 20% moisture(80% Quality) and 120 psia,
printf("The enthalpy of a wet steam mixture at 120 psia having quality 80 percent is 1015 Btu/lbm\n");
//Which also agrees well with the calculated value in problem 5.7
