disp('from the table,we find that at 120C,saturation pressure of water is 198.5 kPa.But here we have pressure of 500 kPa.hence,water exists as a compressed liquid here.')
disp('also at 120C,vf=0.00106 kg/m^3 and vg=0.89186 kg/m^3.given v=0.5 m^3/kg i.e. vf<v<vg,so we have two phase mixture of liquid and vapor.')
