 
 example 14.13   
the damped angular frequency is 7.11radians/sec if speed govenor loop is closed 
 (b)   
since the two area are imilier ,each area will supply half of increase in load .this also evident besause ba=bb  
 change in power 50MW 
 speed regulation is infininydamped angular frequency if speed governor loop is open 2.687rad/sec
