transfer function of governor gr= 1/(1+0.2*s) 
 transfer function of turbine gt=1/(1+2*s)
transfer function of power system 
 Gp=(50/(1+10*s)
 Df=-gp/(1+(0.5*(gr*gt*gp)))
the largest step in the load if the frequency change by more than 0.01 in steady state -18765MW
the minu sign is becose of the that if frequency is to increase by 0.010000 
the change in load be negative.
