  
 Example 2.6   
the energy at different load levels is as under :
load=20MW,energy=480MWh
load=40MW,energy=820MWh
load=80MW,energy=1340MWh
load=100MW,energy=1420MWh
the energy load curve is plotted in fig 1 
the energy supplied up to different times of the day is as under :
energy supplied upto 5 is 100MWh
energy supplied upto 9 is 260MWh
energy supplied upto 18 is 980MWh
energy supplied upto 22 is 1380MWh
