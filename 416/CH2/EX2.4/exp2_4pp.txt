 
 example 2.4   

the chronological load curve is plotted in fig 1 the durition of loads is as under :
	100W	100W	100W	100W	80W	80W	80W	80W	80W	80W	80W	80W	80W	40W	40W	40W	40W	20W	20W	20W	20W	20W	20W	20W
the load duration curve is ploted in 2 the energy produced by plant in 24 hours 
 =100x4+80x(13-4)+40(17-13)+20(24-17)=1420MWh 
load factor =1420/2400=0.591667=59.166667 in persent
