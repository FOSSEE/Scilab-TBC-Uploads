**Sample Problem 4-5**
The velocity vector of the particle at t=5sec in m/s is 
 
         column 1
 
  - 11.641814  
 
         column 2
 
    15.490667  
The magnitude of the velocity vector is 19.377631 m/s
The angle made by the velocity vector with the x axis in degrees at the same time -53.073771
