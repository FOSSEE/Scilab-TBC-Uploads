 Standard formula used 
 D_m^2 -D_n^2 = 4*p*r*lambda

 For 
 1. Wavelength = 6.000000e-05 cm,Difference between square of diameter of two successive rings is 0.093750 cm^2 
 2. Refractive index 1.330000, Difference between square of diameter of two successive rings is 0.093985 cm^2 
 . 
 3.On doubling the radius, Difference between square of diameter of two successive rings will be 0.250000 cm^2.
