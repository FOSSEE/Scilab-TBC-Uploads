//Finding the third force F
//Assume that the third force F makes an angle theta with x-axis
//Resolving the forces we get
//F*cosd(theta)=-225.9...(1)  //N
//F*sind(theta)=-408.9...(2)  //N
//Then (2)/(1) gives
theta=atand(-408.9/-225.9)  //degree
F=sqrt(225.9^2+408.9^2)  //N
printf("The third force is F=%.1f N and makes an angle of theta=%.2f degree",F,theta)
