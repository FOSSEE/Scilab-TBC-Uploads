 # Problem 7 # 

 Standard formula Used 
 lambda = h / (m * v)
 de Broglie wavelength of particle is 3.312000e-37  m.
 Here the de Broglie wavelength is too small to be detected. This wavelength is far smaller than the wavelength of X ray.
 Hence diffraction experiment with such a stream of particle will not be successful.
