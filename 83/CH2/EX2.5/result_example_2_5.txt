Flux linkages of the neutral wire = 0.000010 Wb-T/m

Voltage induced in the neutral = 99

The Voltage drop of phase a(in volts) = 
  - 349.1594 - 204.26943i  


The Voltage drop of phase b(in volts) = 
  - 308.62198 - 140.28272i  


The Voltage drop of phase c(in volts) = 
    621.85121 + 328.22026i
