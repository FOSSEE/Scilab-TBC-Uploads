case(i) when the losses are included but not coordinated
Pg1=274.54 MW    Pg2=37.50 MW

case(ii) when the losses are coordinated
Pg1=128.57 MW    Pg2=125.00 MW

Saving at plant 1 due to loss coordination is = Rs 2923.94/hr

Saving at plant 2 due to loss coordination is = Rs -2034.38/hr

The net saving achieved by coordinating losses while scheduling the recieved load of 237.04MW is Rs 889.56/hr
