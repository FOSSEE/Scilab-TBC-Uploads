disp("A binary counter may be combined with a decoder to obtain a set of 1-out-of-M coded signals, where one signal is asserted in each count state. This is useful when counters are used to control a set of devices, where a different devices is enabled in each counter state.")
disp("The fig.8.74 shows how a 74X163 connected as a modulo-8 counter can be combined with a 74X138 3-8 decoder to provide eight signals, each one representing a counter state.")
