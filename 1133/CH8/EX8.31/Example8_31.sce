disp("The fig. 8.63 shows the cascaded connection of 4-bit binary counters. Let us see the circuit operation. The counter IC1 operates as a counter for countion in the UP direction since CLEAR = LOAD = 1. When the count reaches the maximum value (1111) its RC (Ripple Carry Output) goes HIGH which makes P and T (Enable) inputs of IC2 HIGH for one clock cycle advancing its output by 1 and making Q outputs of IC1, 0 at the next clock cycle. After this clock cycle P = T = 0 for IC2 and IC1 will go on counting the pulses. When the outputs of IC1 and IC2 both reach the maximum count, RC outputs of both of these ICs will go HIGH. This will make P = T of IC3 HIGH and therefore, in the next clock cycle IC3 count will be incremented and simultaneously IC1 and IC2 will be cleared. This way the counting will continue.")
