disp("An excess-3 decimal counter should start counting from count 3 (binary 0011) and count upto count 12 (binary 1100). Starting count is adjusted by loading 0011 at load inputs. To recycle count from 1100 to 0011, Q3 and Q2 output are connected as inputs for 2-input NAND gate. Thus, NAND gate detects state 1100 and forces 0011 to be loaded as the next state.")
