disp("IC 74191 is a 4-bit binary counter. Thus it divides the input frequency by 16. However, we can design MOD-N counter using IC 74191. For MOD-N counter the output frequency will be f_out = f_in / N. Thus by changing N we can change the output frequency. The fig.8.40 shows the programmable frequncy divider using IC 74191.")
